# [InstantClick](http://instantclick.io/)

All the informations you need to use InstantClick are on the link above. This ReadMe’s purpose is about how to use and contribute to a development version of InstantClick.

## Tests

Tests (in the `tests` folder) are PHP-generated HTML pages with which to check how InstantClick behaves on different browsers. That’s what I use before releasing a new version to make sure there are no obvious regressions.

To access the suite of tests, run `php -S 127.0.0.1:8000` from the `tests` folder and head to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).
